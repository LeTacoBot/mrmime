# Mr. Mime: An automatic pattern-based mime type generator.
Usage: ```./mrmime.sh -n name -p pattern -c comment```

----

Name = Mime name, eg: 'text'

Pattern = Mime pattern, eg: '*.txt'

Comment = Mime comment, eg: 'Plain text file'

I'm a big fan of emulation, and I like to play all kinds of weird old consoles. The problem with this is that a lot of the older roms are missing a MIME type, removing the ability to simply click them in a file manager to open in the emulator of my choice. I created Mr. Mime as a way to quickly and efficiently add MIME types based on file extenstions. It requires no privleges to run, and it currently very basic. This is my first time doing anything like this, so feedback is appreciated!
